Musyk is a VR application designed for Valve Index controllers and SteamVR-compatible headsets. The application is developed in Unity, placing the user in a minimalist virtual studio. The application is designed to allow production of simple chord sequences and drum loops, giving the user the ability to experiment with basic Digital Audio Workstation concepts in a virtual room-scale environment.

Locomotion, Interaction 

The player can teleport throughout the virtual environment by pushing up on the right joystick, as well as physically walking in the room-scale area. Objects can be grabbed by physically using the controller grip and activated with the trigger. Both controllers have lasers that allow the player to grab and activate objects from a distance. Pushing the right controller’s joystick left or right will also snap-turn the player 30 degrees, and pulling the joystick back will snap the player backwards, as an accessibility feature. 

 

Visuals & Audio 

Visuals are minimalist, giving the player a clean workspace. The player is suspended on a floating platform in dark space, with tools placed around the platform. Active sequencer blocks are highlighted in green, and objects grabbed by the player have a soft red glow. Audio is played from its respective sequencer, allowing the player to pan audio around the environment. 

 

Global Controls (BPM, Mixing) 

The tempo/speed of the audio in the scene can be dynamically adjusted by the player through buttons in the scene in increments of 1 and 10. Volume for sequencers can be adjusted by a small increase/decrease button next to the track. Any feature in the scene can dragged around the scene by grabbing and moving the box in the top-right of the feature.  

 

Drum Sequencer 

The drum sequencer contains rows and columns of cubes representing beats in musical notation. Columns are highlighted to signify the current beat being played. The sequencer is looped through continuously, and the player can toggle sequencer blocks using the trigger, playing its respective sample. Samples can be modified by the player by inputting sample blocks into the transparent slots near the sequencer. A slot will affect all sequencer blocks on its row. 


Chord Sequencer 

The chord sequencer contains two sections, the chord palette and sequencer. The palette contains various options, selecting chord key, chord type and instrument. After selecting desired options, the chord brush can be used to paint chords onto the four sequencer blocks. An eraser brush is also provided, which can erase chords held in the sequencer blocks. 



Tutorials & Help 

Help buttons are available at every major function, providing the player with a basic guide on how every feature works. This can be retrieved by pressing the ‘?’ button in the top-right corner of the feature.
